# Introduce Octahedron

## Who we are and what we can do for you?

!SLIDE

# What you need?

!SLIDE

*   Be more competitive
*   Higher productivity
*   Make better decisions
*   **Enjoy** instead of **having**

!SLIDE

# IT can help you

> IT must be seen as a service provider comparable to telephone and Internet. Requires excellence because it is part of everyday organization.

!SLIDE

#### "Among the benefits of IT are the reduction of operational costs, improvement of productivity and customer retention."
 
##### **Ana Claudia Plihal**, SMB Customer, Breadth Resellers & Distribution Manager of Microsoft Brasil

!SLIDE

#### "The gains are many. Growing efficiency, profits, competitiveness and trade with other countries. Not to mention the reduction in spending on communication, something that affects the budget of many companies."
 
##### **Cássio Tietê**, marketing director of Intel Brazil

# But...

> (Assuming you have adopted a solution that does what you expect)
>
> A good IT solution, to be effective in its purpose (and really help), must have...

!SLIDE

# Availability & Scalability

!SLIDE

# Availability

> Imagine that your company has adopted an IT solution for inventory control, but this solution is always offline. You do not just have to control your invetory manually, as you done before, but also lose time registering your inventory in application and trying to use it.

!SLIDE

# Scalability

> Or, suppose your e-commerce website has been reported as a reference on TV or radio, and the number of visits had an unusual increase. The structure of the system was not built thinking in this peak and probably will not last. You will not only fail to meet new customers, but also the old and faithful clients. 
>
> In the end, your main IT concern is not wasting resources, but do not lose business.

!SLIDE

*   Capacity planning 
    *   Unexpected growth of demand
    *   Waste of time and resources

*   High operational cost
    *   Hardware acquisition
    *   Skilled people
    *   Infrastructure maintenance

> How many machines do you (think) need? And if demand grows unexpectedly? And if the machine goes down? And if the network goes down?
>
> Capacity planning and high operational cost are two major problems regarding the availability and scalability, that are the most important things when adopting IT solutions.

!SLIDE

# It takes time and money...

## and this is not your focus!

!SLIDE

# Invest your time on what you do best!

> You should not worry about IT, you should keep the focus on your business. 

!SLIDE

# What do you really wish?

> What would be the best scenario for adopting IT?

!SLIDE 

*   Low cost of IT implantation  
*   (Almost) zero maintenance
*   Do not waste resources
*   Tech resources on demand

> Again, this is a vision of IT as a service and not as part of a (non IT) company.

!SLIDE

# "Is this real life?"

!SLIDE

# Yeah, it is!

!SLIDE
