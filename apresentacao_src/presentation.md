# IT can help you

> IT must be seen as a service provider comparable to telephone and Internet. Requires excellence because it is part of everyday organization.

!SLIDE

#### "Entre o benefícios da TI estão a redução de custos operacionais, a melhoria de produtividade e a retenção de clientes."
 
##### **Ana Claudia Plihal**, gerente comercial de PMEs e distribuição Microsoft Brasil

!SLIDE

#### "Os ganhos são inúmeros. Crescem a eficiência, os lucros, a competitividade e a troca com outros países. Sem falar na redução dos gastos com comunicação, algo que ainda compromete o orçamento de muitas empresas."
 
##### **Cássio Tietê**, diretor de marketing Intel Brasil

# But...

> (Assuming you have adopted a solution that does what you expect)

> A good IT solution, to be effective in its purpose (and really help), must have...

# Availability & Scalability

!SLIDE

# Availability

> Imagine that your company has adopted an IT solution for inventory control, but this solution is always offline. You do not just have to control your invetory manually, as you done before, but also lose time registering your inventory in application and trying to use it.

!SLIDE

# Scalability

>Or, suppose your e-commerce website has been reported as a reference on TV or radio, and the accessions had an unusual increase. The structure of the system was not built thinking in this peak and probably will not last. You will not only fail to meet new customers, but also the old and faithful clients. 
>
> In the end, your big IT concern is not wasting resources, but do not lose business.

!SLIDE

*   Capacity planning 
    *   Unexpected growth of demand
    *   Waste of time and resources

*   High operational cost
    *   Hardware acquisition
    *   Skilled people
    *   Infrastructure maintenance

> How many machines do you (think) need? And if demand grows unexpectedly? And if the machine goes down? And if the network goes down?
>
> Capacity planning and high operational cost are two major problems regarding the availability and scalability and that weigh more time to adopt IT solutions. Planejamento de capacidade e custo operacional elevado são dois dos principais problemas referentes a disponibilidade e escalabilidade e que mais pesam na hora de adotar soluções de TI.

# It takes time and money...

## and this is not your focus!

!SLIDE

# Invest your time on what you do best!

> You should not worry about IT, you should keep the focus on your business. 

!SLIDE

# What do you really wish?

> What would be the best scenario for adopting IT?

!SLIDE 

*   Low cost of IT implantation Baixo custo de implantação de TI  
*   (Almost) zero maintenance
*   Do not waste resources
*   Tech resources on demand

> Again, this is a vision of IT as a service and not as part of a (non IT) company.
