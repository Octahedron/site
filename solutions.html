									<h3>For you</h3>
									<p>Born in the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Cloud_computing" target="blank">cloud computing</a> era, the <strong>Octahedron</strong> provides consulting on cloud computing technologies and develops applications to these environments. Our main goal is to provides robust solutions with <strong>low operational costs</strong>.</p>
									<h4>The problem</h4>
									<p>Convectional applications tend to collapse with the growth of their demands, or for not have the necessary infrastructure, or because of a high operational cost during you life-cycle.</p>
									<p>When adopting an IT solution, we know that the most part of the cost is spent on the infrastructure maintenance.</p>
									<h4>The solution</h4>
									<p>What you need is a robust solution, that correspond to your expectations and with a operational cost proportional to the usage. It makes possible to companies of any size to plan your invests in large scale systems and take more from the IT technologies.</p>
									<p>According to a <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/assets/pdf/analysts/IDC_Force.com_Business_Case.pdf" target="_blank">study</a>, performed by the <a href="http://www.idc.com/" target="_blank">IDC</a> (International Data Corporation), the cloud computing applications' development takes about <strong>%76</strong> less time, and companies can reduce their three years TCO by <strong>54%</strong> using this solutions.</p>

									<h3>Why on the cloud?</h3>
									<p>Let's take a look at the main cloud computing advantages? ;)
									<h4>Scalability on demand (pay-as-you-go)</h4>
									<p>If an organization has periods of time in which their computing resource needs are much higher or lower than normal, cloud technologies can deal with those changes. The organization pays for the IT resources it actually uses; it does not have to maintain multiple sets of artificially high levels of resources to handle peak demands.</p>
									<h4>Improving Business Processes</h4>
									<p>An organization and its suppliers and partners can share data and applications in the cloud, allowing everyone involved to focus on the business process instead of the infrastructure that hosts it.</p>
									<h4>Minimizing Startup Costs</h4>
									<p>For companies that are just starting out, organizations in emerging market, cloud computing greatly reduces startup costs. The new organization starts with an infrastructure already in place, so the time and other resources that would be spent on building a data center are borne by the cloud provider.</p>

									<h3>How we work</h3>
									<h4>Methodology</h4>
									<p>We use an agile development and management methodology on our projects. This type of methodology aims to deal better with changing priorities and requirements as to minimize project risks. It also allows to the customer a better monitoring of and involvement in managerial decision-making team.</p>
									<p>Ideally, at the end of each cycle is delivered a working version of the system under development to the customer. This practice allows the customer to provide feedback about their impressions of the system throughout the process.</p>
									<h4>Technologies</h4>
									<p>We understand that technologies change and meet different needs, so we seek diversify them in order to deal with any challenges, always aiming for the best user experience possible for our customers.</p>
									<p>As cloud environment, we use:</p>
									<ul class="list">
										<li>Google App Engine</li>
										<li>Amazon Web Services</li>
										<li>Heroku</li>
									</ul>
									<p>About technologies, we use:</p>
									<ul class="list">
										<li>Java</li>
										<li>Python</li>
										<li>Ruby</li>
										<li>XHTML/HTML 5</li>
										<li>CSS2/CSS3</li>
										<li>Ajax/JQuery</li>
										<li>Flex</li>
									</ul>

									<h3>Open source projects</h3>
									<h4>Cotopaxi</h4>
									<p>Cotopaxi is a Java Framework for development of web applications, focused on the cloud. The main objective is make the development of applications more agile, providing access to all the resources needed on the cloud and providing abstractions to the controller layer. Using Cotopaxi, developers keep the focus on the model/business layer and can make applications scalable running on the cloud.</p>
